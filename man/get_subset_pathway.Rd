\title{Subsets the mapped KO table based on pathways.}
\usage{
get_subset_pathway(mapped_ko_table, type_of_interest_feature,
interest_feature)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapped_ko_table}{a data frame object. The output table from
the mapping_ko function.}

\item{type_of_interest_feature}{is a mapped_ko column name. This feature
is going to be used for subsetting.}

\item{interest_feature}{a character vector of the mapped_ko
feature of interest. It is found under the type_of_interest_feature
value column.}
}
\description{
reads the output of the mapping_ko function to filter out KOs
based on pathways.
}
\details{
This function is part of a package used for the analysis of
bins metabolism.
