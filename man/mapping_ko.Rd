\usage{
mapping_ko(tibble_ko=NULL, tibble_interpro=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tibble_ko}{a data frame object with four columns containing
the KO abundance for each bin. Output of read_ko.}

\item{tibble_interpro}{a data frame with three columns. The first column
refers to contigs. They are expected to indicate in their names
the bin name follow by the scaffold name divided by an "_":
bin_scaffoldXX. The second column is the KEGG pathway to which
such scaffold belong, and the third is the enzymes.
Output of read_interpro.}

and maps each KO to the KEGG database.
