R tools for reconstructing bin metabolisms.

## Quick install

We are actively developing rbims, for now it is not available at CRAN or Bioconductor, however you can access the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/mirnavazquez/RbiMs).

In R terminal:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

If you are in a MAC system, you will need to download [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/), you can read more about it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38952427/include-cairo-r-on-a-mac). As well if you are in ubuntu you need to install libcairo2-dev, you can read more about it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51940792/r-cairo-package-installation-failed-in-ubuntu-18-04).

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("mirnavazquez/RbiMs")
library(rbims)
```

## New function to write a metabolism workbook

If you want to create a metabolism table in excel that includes KEGG and interproscan outputs you can use this new function.

```
library(rbims)
write_metabolism("Interpro_test.tsv", 
                 "path/to/KEGG/output/")
```
