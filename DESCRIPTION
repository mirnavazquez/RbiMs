Description: This package is meant to be used for the analysis of microbial metabolism. rbims reads different database outputs and includes a new custom-curated database that the user can easily access. Its module-based design allows the user to choose between running the whole pipeline or just part of it. Finally, a key feature is that it facilitates the incorporation of metadata such as taxonomy and sampling data, allowing the user to answer specific questions of biological relevance.
